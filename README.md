# Python-questions

This repository contains a series of interview questions for the programming language python, along with solutions. The questions themselves are typically of either a moderate or advanced difficulty. Within each folder is a `README.md` file containing the problem, as well as a `solution.py` file containing the solution.

Please note that the solutions provided are not necessarily the most effective or efficient method, however they are all "functional" implementations.
